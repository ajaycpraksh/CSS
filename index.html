                    In 2013, the company collaborated with the Swedish clothing company Cheap Monday after ordering new work uniforms from them; Kouthoofd had previously collaborated with creative director, Ann-Sofie Back.[7] The companies jointly announced the Pocket Operator (PO-10) synthesizer series in January 2015.[8] The series includes three models: PO-12 rhythm, a drum machine; PO-14 sub, a bass synthesizer; and PO-16 factory, a lead synthesizer. Each model doubles as a 16-step sequencer. According to CEO Jesper Kouthoofd, Teenage Engineering sought to design synthesizers that would retail for US$49; however, each PO actually retails from US$59 to US$99. The POs target musicians seeking a less expensive alternative to the OP-1, which currently retails for US$1,399. The series uses a minimalist design, evoking pocket calculators and, according to Kouthoofd, Nintendo's Game & Watch games.[9] Sonically, they emulate vintage synthesizers, in response to the contemporary surge in the popularity of retro style electronic music gear.[10] The synthesizers debuted at the 2015 NAMM Show.[7] The Pocket Operators were a success at NAMM, and sales were estimated by third parties to be as high as 40,000 units, which delayed shipments by up to three months.
                    The PO-20 series of the Pocket Operators were introduced at the 2016 NAMM show. The PO-20 synthesizers have some additional effects and functionality that were not present in the original PO-10 series, but maintain the US$59 price point.[12] The PO-30 series further elaborates upon the original Pocket operators by adding a drum synthesizer made in collaboration with MicroTonic, a sampler, and a voice synthesizer. These were released starting in late 2017 at a slightly increased price from previous series. PO-30 devices feature a microphone for use in recording audio samples and for transferring data.Teenage Engineering is a Swedish consumer electronics company and manufacturer founded in 2005 by Jesper Kouthoofd, David Eriksson, Jens Rudberg and David Möllerstedt and based in Stockholm.
